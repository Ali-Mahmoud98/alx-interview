### The Problem:
You have a text file with a single character "H". Your text editor allows you to perform only two operations:
1. **Copy All**: This operation copies all the text currently in the file.
2. **Paste**: This operation pastes what you copied into the file.

Your task is to start with one "H" and figure out how many operations it takes to end up with exactly `n` "H" characters in the file, using the minimum number of operations.

### Example for Clarity:
Let's say `n = 9`, meaning you want to end up with 9 "H" characters in the file:

1. **Initially**, you have one "H".
2. **Copy All**: You copy the single "H".
3. **Paste**: Now you have "HH" (2 "H" characters).
4. **Paste again**: Now you have "HHH" (3 "H" characters).
5. **Copy All** again: Now you copy "HHH".
6. **Paste**: Now you have "HHHHHH" (6 "H" characters).
7. **Paste again**: Now you have "HHHHHHHHH" (9 "H" characters).

In this case, you performed 6 operations (copying and pasting) to reach 9 "H" characters.

### The Goal:
You need to write a function that calculates the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly `n` "H" characters in the file. If it's impossible, the function should return 0.

### How to Calculate the Number of Operations:
- If you think of the number `n` that you want to achieve, you can break it down into smaller factors (factors of the number).
- For example, if `n = 9`, you can see that 9 = 3 * 3.
- By increasing the number of "H" characters step by step according to these factors, you can achieve the goal with the minimum number of operations.
